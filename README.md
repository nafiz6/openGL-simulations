#2D Bubbles simulation

The camera is fixed looking at the center of the green boundary square from a
perpendicular position. There is red circle inside the square.
After the program starts, five bubbles will pop up one by one from the left bottom
region of the square and start moving towards a random direction. None of the
bubbles will go out of the boundary square. Rather, they will be reflected upon colliding
with the boundary of the square. Note that, the bubbles that haven’t yet gone inside
the red circle will cross one another.
When a bubble goes completely inside the red circle, it will never go out of the circle.
Rather, it will reflect upon colliding with the circle. It will also reflect with other bubbles
that are completely inside the red circle. Note that, the bubble will not reflect with bubbles
that are outside the red circle even partially.

The program will also support the following functionalities.

Up arrow – increase the speed of the bubbles
Down arrow – decrease the speed of the bubbles
Press ‘p’ – resume/pause the movement of the bubbles
There should be an upper and lower bound for the speed of the bubbles so that the
speed can’t be increased to ∞ and decreased to 0.
The length of the square and the radius of the circle and bubbles are not strictly
specified. Adjust the values in order to reproduce the given figure as close as possible.
The bubbles have the same velocity.

Left click the mouse to fire the gun.
Right click the mouse to toggle viewing the axis.
Press the keys q, w, e, r, a, s, d and f to find out how the gun rotates. Also observe that
after certain amount, each joint ceases to rotate.
